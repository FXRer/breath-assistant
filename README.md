# Breath Assistant
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kolyunya/breath-assistant.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Kolyunya/breath-assistant)

## Description
Do you concentrate so much while working that you forget to breath deeply? This application will breath with you and will help you to maintain a constant breath rate. It creates a nice looking overlay on your screen which reminds you to breath deeply and not to hold your breath. Adjust breath rate and overlay properties to your needs and breath with the application.

The following parameters are configurable:

* Breath rate.
* Overlay thickness.
* Overlay opacity.
* Overlay color.

Application supports multiple desktops seamlessly. Application overlay is see through and click through. User preferences are preserved automatically. Main window can be minimized to tray.
